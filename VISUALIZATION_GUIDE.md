# STAGE 7: VISUALIZATION OUTPUTS

## Generated Figures for Thesis

### Figure 1: Preference Evaluation Results
**File:** `figure1_preference_metrics.png`
**Description:** Shows F1, Precision, and Recall scores for all algorithms
**Use in thesis:** Section on recommendation quality / preference alignment

### Figure 2: Liked & Safe Rate
**File:** `figure2_liked_and_safe.png`
**Description:** Combined preference + safety evaluation
**Use in thesis:** Main results section - this is your PRIMARY metric

### Figure 3: Cuisine Filtering Effect
**File:** `figure3_cuisine_filtering_effect.png`
**Description:** Side-by-side comparison of Selected vs All cuisines with p-values
**Use in thesis:** This demonstrates your MAIN CONTRIBUTION (cuisine filtering)
**Key insight:** Shows highly significant improvements (p<0.001) from cuisine filtering

### Figure 4: Three Perspectives
**File:** `figure4_three_perspectives.png`
**Description:** Liked & Safe, Coverage, and Acceptance rates side-by-side
**Use in thesis:** Comprehensive evaluation section

### Figure 5: Summary Table
**File:** `figure5_summary_table.png`
**Description:** Complete comparison table of all metrics
**Use in thesis:** Results summary / appendix

## Statistical Significance Notation

In Figure 3, the stars above bars indicate:
- `***` p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- `**`  p < 0.01  (very significant)
- `*`   p < 0.05  (significant)
- `ns`  p ≥ 0.05  (not significant)

## Color Coding

- **Green bars:** Cuisine-filtered algorithms (Selected)
- **Gray bars:** Cross-cuisine algorithms (All)
- **Highlighted cells:** Best performance in each metric (Figure 5)

## Thesis Recommendations

1. Use Figure 3 to demonstrate your main contribution (cuisine filtering)
2. Use Figure 2 as your primary results figure (Liked & Safe rate)
3. Use Figure 1 to show traditional recommendation metrics
4. Include Figure 5 in appendix for complete comparison
5. Reference statistical significance from Stage 6 results
