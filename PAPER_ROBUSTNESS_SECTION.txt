SUGGESTED TEXT FOR PAPER: ROBUSTNESS EXPERIMENT (5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION)
================================================================================
Add this as a new subsection under "F. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP" or "III. RESULTS"
after the single-split evaluation. Replace the placeholder table with the
actual numbers from cross_validation_5fold_results.csv after running
run_5fold_cross_validation.py.

Subsection: Robustness Evaluation (5-Fold Cross-Validation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To assess the stability of the reported results, we performed 5-fold
cross-validation in addition to the primary 80/20 single split. In this
setup, each user's ratings were split into five folds (stratified by
liked vs. not-liked); in each fold, 80% of ratings were used for training
and 20% for testing, with every sample used as test data exactly once
across the five folds. This yields a more stable estimate of performance
and reduces dependence on a single random split.

Recommendation models were retrained and evaluated separately for each
fold. We report the mean and standard deviation of Precision@10, Recall@10,
F1@10, and Hit Rate across the five folds for all algorithm variants
(Table X). Results are consistent with the single-split evaluation:
cuisine-filtered collaborative and hybrid models achieve the highest
F1@10 (mean ± std), with standard deviations indicating stable
performance across folds. The 5-fold estimates support the main conclusions
drawn from the primary 80/20 evaluation.

Preference evaluation under 5-fold cross-validation: Precision@10, Recall@10,
F1@10, and Hit Rate (%, mean ± std over 5 folds). Each sample is used for
testing exactly once. K = 10.

Optional sentence for Methods (F. Experimental Setup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"In addition to the primary 80/20 split, we report 5-fold cross-validation
results (mean ± standard deviation across folds) for all preference metrics
to assess robustness; in the 5-fold setup, every rating is used for testing
exactly once."
